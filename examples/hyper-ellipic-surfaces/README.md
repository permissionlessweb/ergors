-- context: polyonmials that can create groupings of context based on their resulting values
-- my explination: you can create polynomial equations that result in specific possible value sets relating to any specific relational meaning.This could be useful for embedding classification. Meaning that a very specific location of one of these curves polynomials, could relate to each other, and these embeddings can be stored in a meaningful way that brings additional context/relation analysis possibilities. This seems recursive and powerful, for infinite clarity on context and relational embeddings , building metaq layers of context for very custom transform,embedding agentic system improvements.
